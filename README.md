# QuditsOnQubits

Clean working repository for qutrit-on-qubit graph-state circuits, direct-basis encoding benchmarks, and qutrit Bell measurement pipelines.

This repo intentionally starts without historical bulk benchmark dumps. The previous repository should be kept locally as `QuditsOnQubits_legacy` for archival lookup. Future IQM/direct-basis simulation outputs should go under `artifacts/`, with selected best circuits copied into the relevant `selected_best/` folder.

## Layout

```text

  core/              # graph-state and AME circuit helpers
  benchmarks/        # direct-basis benchmark code
  bell_measurements/ # qutrit Bell measurement pipeline
  encoding_search/   # candidate generation/search helpers
scripts/             # runnable entry points
notebooks/working/   # active research notebooks
artifacts/           # local result folders and manifest template
tests/               # smoke and regression tests
```

## Setup

```powershell
conda activate qudityD3_laptop
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

Run smoke tests:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Direct-Basis Top-K Selection

Run a full direct-basis benchmark for one Bell-supported state and copy selected circuits:

```powershell
python scripts/run_direct_basis_benchmarks.py `
  --state ghz3 `
  --candidate-set all-qutrit-u3 `
  --n-transpile-runs 20 `
  --approximation-thresholds 0.99,0.95,0.90 `
  --select-top-k 5
```

This runs `exact`, `fid099`, `fid095`, and `fid090`. Threshold labels pass `approximation_degree` into Qiskit transpilation; selected threshold rows must also satisfy `fidelity >= threshold`. Selected circuits are written under `artifacts/direct_basis_runs/selected_best/<state>/<run_id>/`.

For a fast smoke run:

```powershell
python scripts/run_direct_basis_benchmarks.py `
  --state two_qutrit `
  --candidate-set sanity `
  --limit-candidates 3 `
  --n-transpile-runs 1 `
  --local-line-coupling `
  --approximation-thresholds 0.99,0.95,0.90 `
  --select-top-k 2
```

Small smoke candidate sets may warn that a threshold label selected fewer than `top-k` rows; that means the measured fidelity did not pass that threshold. The `exact` label still selects the best depth-ranked circuits.

Load the rank-1 transpiled circuit from a selected run:

```powershell
python scripts/load_best_circuit.py `
  --run-kind direct_basis_runs `
  --state two_qutrit `
  --run-id <printed_run_id> `
  --selection-label exact `
  --rank 1
```
